2 code scripts are provided:

1.  Foodtask DNN --> it has both the code AND the comments present in the REPORT
2.  Foodtask DNN only code --> dry version. It has only the code and minor comments to understand the code

Please note that I can't assure the reproducibility of the codes as all the data are stored in my drive.
